BUGS:


==========================


Something with the main menu, shader on the moving fingerprint
when changing from title scene to any other scene
sometimes this happens


E 0:00:03:0273   call: Trying to call a lambda with an invalid instance.
  <C++ Source>   modules/gdscript/gdscript_lambda_callable.cpp:217 @ call()


E 0:00:03:0273   step: Error calling method from MethodTweener: 'Label::<anonymous lambda>': Instance is null.
  <C++ Error>    Method/function failed. Returning: false
  <C++ Source>   scene/animation/tween.cpp:826 @ step()

STRETCH GOALS (post-jam):


======================


-- add background art for achievements menu / update text style

red flash timer when low on time (<60 sec left?)

skip text faster if already seen in a playthrough
(hold left click, right click??)

do more combos of actions (body in bed, body out window, etc.)

(new weapons?)

EVIDENCE:
move toilet grating and put gun in toilet grating?
open window and throw body/gun out the window?
grab towels from bed or sink stand to mop up the blood?

put gun in trashcan?
put mop in garbage disposal?
put the key in the garbage disposal?


OTHER OPTIONS:
shoot the lock on the storage closet door to open it
horseshoe crab racing knowledge? (for window guy event)
move the bed to find the key


MUSIC:
-main menu music
-keep game music the same
-if add window guy music: needs to be able to occur at any time (not sure if 5 min is final.)



ACHIEVEMENTS:
achievement for just leaving the gun?
achievement for just leaving the blood?

SOUND EFFECTS:
-Sound effects for unlocking achievements

EVENTS:
-Shoot out police minigame if gun equipped when leaving
-Dialogue action to pee in the toilet

how to get into person's password for laptop
erase diary entry (someones out to get me)



Accessibility:
Ensure buttons are large enough for touch screen
Add option for mouse sensitivity (?)




======================


CHANGELOG:


======================

# -- update style of itch page (screenshots, videos, css.)

# VARIATION IN STARTING TEXT:
# depending on which achievement is unlocked--snuck out of jail?
# come back -- ahh man my three followers really hated that. that went viral (Live on Twitch)
# (blurb at the start of the game, based on which achievement was last unlocked.)

# fixed lamp glow not resetting

# Alpha for locked achievements
# Yellow highlights for mouse over (unlocked?) acheivements
# Tooltip hint for locked achievements

# menu music
# game music
# Dialogue

# panic music feels a little too tense... should be more fun/lighthearted


# achievement art icons (128x128)
# need art for storage_closet open in scene 3

# add door open when leaving scene 1
# add computer_on when clicking desktop monitor (add desktop (horseshoe crab) art)
# add lamp on/off texture?

# sam never saw window guy :(
# 5:00 -> 2:30 (3:00? 3:30? 4:00? 1.5x time?)
# maybe make him appear at 3:00

# ok, let's try appear at 4:00 and still double time
# so you get 1 free minute, then 2 minutes double time
# (so 3 minutes total, but if you close the curtains you get 5 minutes.)

# how to use items? (figured out eventually.)

# random text for garbage disposal
# should mop still be there if you drink the blood?***

# nightstand updated
# ***mop should still be there if you drink the blood?
# ***put body under bed new art

# how to look under bed? (hard to figure out--make under bed box better.)
# --updated hitbox to be bigger, and takes priority over bed_top

# add under bed box to both scenes?

# Add an "old_art" global/saved bool. Main menu option button to enable/disable.
# When enabled, use the old (current) art.
# When disabled, use the new art.

# (Will have to find a way to maintain both --
# save branch as scene, load different ones depending on selection?
# need to double check if just those 4 things are affected.)

# Volume controls for effects and music



















=====================================================================================

Old stuff:

=====================================================================================


target resolution:
non pixel art: 1280 x 720
pixel art: 640 x 360
32 x 32 tiles



Given a word or phase, need to be able to erase letters

2D Excavator -- Right click to reveal what is underneath a tile

Erase -- Draw a tunnel for a ball to roll through.
Play as a mole excavating a tunnel to the center of the earth.
Erase dirt tiles to move in that direction.
Some tiles already show what are in them, so you can head towards those.

Sharpen your claws so you can excavate more dirt at once



=============================

Floating /perspective tiles that get erased
Kind of like Bastion?

procedural generation of tiles after opening new paths

godot 4:
given 4 tile map layers (basic_tile, wall_tile, select_tile, player_tile)


add a new function called draw_tile() that functions similar to erase tile
except it checks get_parent().b


=============================

Level design, mechanics
so many blocks, put them down somewhere?

Muqic -- Alex
R. Lettece -- Jocyleyn (pixel art--backgrounds?)

not word based?
combat? clicking vs. WASD


moving screen--mole dig tunnel

timer to erase evidence
2 levels?

use mop to clean up the blood
5 min track--panick closer to zero
police sirens?

how to get into person's password for laptop
erase diary entry (someones out to get me)
inventory?

art style -- physically erase the object?
click left/right to change scenes


==============

tooltip on hover?
just click around?

Erase the Evidence
Crime Wipe
Magic Eraser


==============

inventory options

Erase the Evidence
MURDER 101 (it's in the syllabus)
Netflix and Kill
Ramen, Regret, and a Revolver
