Godot Wild Jam (GWJ) #78:
Erase

target resolution:
non pixel art: 1280 x 720
pixel art: 640 x 360
32 x 32 tiles

Given a word or phase, need to be able to erase letters

2D Excavator -- Right click to reveal what is underneath a tile

Erase -- Draw a tunnel for a ball to roll through.
Play as a mole excavating a tunnel to the center of the earth.
Erase dirt tiles to move in that direction.
Some tiles already show what are in them, so you can head towards those.

Sharpen your claws so you can excavate more dirt at once



=============================

Floating /perspective tiles that get erased
Kind of like Bastion?

procedural generation of tiles after opening new paths

godot 4:
given 4 tile map layers (basic_tile, wall_tile, select_tile, player_tile)


add a new function called draw_tile() that functions similar to erase tile
except it checks get_parent().b
