Erase

target resolution:
non pixel art: 1280x720
pixel art: 640 x 360


Given a word or phase, need to be able to erase letters

2D Excavator -- Right click to reveal what is underneath a tile

Erase -- Draw a tunnel for a ball to roll through.
Play as a mole excavating a tunnel to the center of the earth.
Erase dirt tiles to move in that direction.
Some tiles already show what are in them, so you can head towards those.

Sharpen your claws so you can excavate more dirt at once



=============================

Floating /perspective tiles that get erased
Kind of like Bastion?
